# 🧠 K-Means Clustering from Scratch & Sklearn – A Comparative Study

## 📌 Overview

This project provides a comprehensive and insightful exploration of **K-Means Clustering**, a widely used unsupervised learning algorithm. It includes both:

* A **manual implementation** of the K-Means algorithm from scratch using NumPy, and
* A **comparison with Scikit-learn's implementation**.

Through detailed explanations, visualizations, and step-by-step coding, this notebook aims to **build intuition** behind how clustering works and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios.
